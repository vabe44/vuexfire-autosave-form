Great. Here is a little assignment:
1. Create a Google Firestore account.

2. Build a form with 5 fields with autosave ability and show the percentage of form completion to the user. Assume each field accounts for 20% of the form.

Specifics:
- Use TailwindCSS (tailwindcss.com) for design and UI
- Use Cloud Firestore as database
- Use Vue (https://vuejs.org/) and Vuexfire (https://vuefire.vuejs.org/vuexfire/) to save data in the database

3. Write a Cloud Function event to calculate form completion percentage in the backend.

Please, share the GitHub link of the assignment only with clear readme.md for the review.
In readme.md, please, mention the case study, test assignment description, what approach you followed, and why.
